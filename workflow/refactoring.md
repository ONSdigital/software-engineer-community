# Refactoring

* Leave code you touch in a better state than when you found it (Boy Scout Rule).
* Don't include changes to areas of code completely unrelated to the current work/story/issue.
* If areas of refactoring are identified outside the scope of the current work and agreed not to be tackled now then a new card/tech debt issue should be created and linked in.
* If tests don't exist for the code you're working on add them
