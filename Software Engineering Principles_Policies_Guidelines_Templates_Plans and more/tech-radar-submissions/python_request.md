# Request for Technology Radar Review 

 

## Technology Name 

Python

 

## Description 

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python has a vast standard library and a large ecosystem of third-party packages, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis and machine learning.

 

## Current Status 

Adopt

 

## Potential Benefits 

- **Ease of Use**: Python's simple syntax and readability make it accessible for beginners and efficient for experienced developers.
- **Versatility**: Python can be used for various applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and automation.
- **Strong Community Support**: Python has a large and active community, providing extensive resources, libraries, and frameworks.
- **Integration Capabilities**: Python can easily integrate with other languages and

 

## Risks and Challenges 

- **Performance**: Python is generally slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java, which may be a concern for performance-critical applications.
- **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**: The GIL can be a limitation for multi-threaded applications, affecting concurrency and parallelism.
- **Dependency Management**: Managing dependencies and virtual environments can be complex, especially in larger projects.
- **Version Compatibility**: Differences between Python 2 and Python 3 can lead to compatibility issues, although Python 2 is now officially deprecated.


## Costs

Free and open-source, but potential costs include training, development time, and infrastructure for deployment.

 

## Recomendation 

Hold

 

### For Assess Circle 

- **Initial Findings**: [Summarise the initial research and prototyping results] 

- **Recommendations**: [Provide recommendations for categorisation in the Assess circle] 

 

### For Trial Circle 

- **Results from Initial Assessment**: [Summarise the findings from the initial assessment] 

- **Pilot Plan**: [Detail the plan for the pilot project, including objectives, scope, and timeline] 

- **Criteria for Success**: [Define the criteria for evaluating the success of the pilot] 

 

### For Adopt Circle 

- **Results from Trial**: [Summarise the findings from the trial phase] 

- **Benefits**: [Outline the benefits of adopting the technology] 

- **Implementation Guidelines**: [Provide guidelines for implementing the technology within the organisation] 

 

### For Hold Circle 

- **Issues and Risks**: Performance concerns and GIL limitations for multi-threaded applications.

- **Rationale for Hold**: I don't like Python. We should use Rust instead because it's better in every way.
