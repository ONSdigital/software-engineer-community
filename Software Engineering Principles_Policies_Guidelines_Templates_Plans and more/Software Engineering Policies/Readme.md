__Software Engineering Policies:__ The software development policies focused on the __WHAT__ aspect of software development; whereas implementation plans and guidelines focus on the __HOW__ aspect. These policies provide specific practices and procedures for software engineering activities, aiming to ensure consistency in the development and maintenance of software products. This will also improve the ability to evidence compliance in this space. In the first phase, TAG has finalised the following policies, along with supporting guidelines and other artefacts:
