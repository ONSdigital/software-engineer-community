# <h1> Preparing for Change: Software Engineering Principles and Policies Implementation

I am pleased to announce that the Technical Advisory Group (TAG), comprising members from the Software Engineering, DevSecOps, Testing, and Security communities, have finalised a set of Software Engineering Principles and Policies after weeks of collaborative effort. 

We have created a [SharePoint Portal](https://officenationalstatistics.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/ONS_DDaT_Communities/SitePages/SE%20-%20Principles,%20Policies,%20Guidelines%20%26%20more.aspx?csf=1&web=1&share=EQI8qpmdcZ1MvVA__6yKAtgBkWCMhU-pty-SBeAs1KVAEQ&e=Pfll6j) to host all agreed software principles, policies, and other artefacts.

> __•	Software Engineering Principles:__ Software engineering principles focus on high-level goals, values, and desired outcomes of the software development process, serving as a foundation for our policies and emphasising the "WHY" of software engineering. It is important that you fully familiarise yourself with these principles and take them into account throughout the SDLC process.

> __•	Software Engineering Policies:__ The software development policies focused on the WHAT aspect of software development; whereas implementation plans and guidelines focus on the HOW aspect. These policies provide specific practices and procedures for software engineering activities, aiming to ensure consistency in the development and maintenance of software products.  This will also improve the ability to evidence compliance in this space. 

__Agreed Software Engineering Principles:__ The following principles have been established to guide our software engineering practices:
- Secure by Design
- Automated by Default
- Consistent Environment
- Design for Testability
- Get Feedback Early and Often
- Design for Emergent Reuse
- Understandability
- Performance Importance

__Agreed Software Engineering Policies:__ TAG has finalised the following policies, along with supporting guidelines and other artefacts:

__Policies__
- Source Control Management Policy
- GitHub Usage Policy
- GitHub Copilot (AI Assisted Coding) Policy & Governance  

__Guidelines__
- GitHub Internal or Private repository usage Guidelines

__Implementation Plans, Templates and Automation__
-	Now & Future Implementation.
-	Retrospective Implementation.
-	Templated Repository.

__Future Initiatives:__ TAG is now working on Coding Policy & Technical Documentation Policy, we are aiming to release these policies along with guidance’s, templates and implementation plan in next few months, while we are working on additional Software Engineering Policies, our current focus is on the implementation of the above agreed-upon policies first.

Your support in communicating and championing these initiatives within your respective teams is crucial to their success. We thank you in advance for your assistance with this.
